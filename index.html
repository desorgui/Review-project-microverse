					Sir Isaac Newton PRS (25 December 1642 - 20 March 1726/27[a]) was an
					English mathematician, physicist, astronomer, alchemist, theologian,
					and author (described in his time as a "natural philosopher") widely
					recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians and physicists of all
					time and among the most influential scientists. He was a key figure in
					the philosophical revolution known as the Enlightenment. His book
					Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (Mathematical Principles
					of Natural Philosophy), first published in 1687, established classical
					mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and
					shares credit with German mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for
					developing infinitesimal calculus.
